**WHAT IS DATA SCIENCE?**
* To extract the hidden information/insights from the data through statistical analysis, comp tatjon, visualization; that help the
  organizations to take right business decisions.

**Types Of AI**
1. Narrow AI
2. Strong AI
3. Super AI

### Narrow AI (Weak AI):

* Narrow Al, also known as Weak Al or Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI), refers to Al systems that are highly specialized and designed to excel in a specific, well-
defined task or a limited set of tasks.
* These systems lack general intelligence and cannot perform tasks outside their narrow domain.
* Examples:
    - Speech Recognition: Voice-activated virtual assistants like Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa are examples of Narrow Al. They can understand and respond
      to spoken language but are limited to specific tasks like setting reminders or  answering questions.
    - Image Recognition: Applications that can identify objects or patterns in images, such as Google Photos' image recognition feature, are instances of
      Narrow Al. They are designed for a specific image analysis task.
      1. Chatbots:
          1. _Examples_: Customer support chatbots, Facebook Messenger bots
          2. _Capabilities_: Chatbots use NLP to engage in conversations with users, answering queries, providing information, and assisting with tasks. They are commonly   
             employed in customer service applications to handle routine inquiries.
      2. Email Filtering and Spam Detection:
          1. _Examples_: Gmail's spam filter, Microsoft Outlook's Clutter feature
          2. _Capabilities_: Narrow Al algorithms analyze incoming emails, learning from user interactions to identify and filter out spam or unwanted messages, improving
             the efficiency of email management.   
      3. Language Translation:
          1. _Examples_: Google Translate, Microsoft Translator
          2. _Capabilities_: Narrow Al systems for language translation use machine learning techniques to analyze and translate text or speech from one language to another,
             facilitating communication across language barriers.

* Key Characteristics of Narrow Al:
  1. _Specialization_: Narrow Al is designed for specialized tasks, excelling within its I dedicated domain, and often surpassing human performance in that area.
  2. _Lack of Generalization_: Unlike AGI, Narrow Al is unable to transfer its knowledge or skills to unrelated tasks, remaining confined to its designated area of         
     expertise.
  3. _Data-Driven Nature_: The performance of Narrow Al relies heavily on the quality and quantity of data it receives, making data preprocessing and curation critical
     for its efficacy.
  4. _Real-time Processing_: These Al systems excel at providing real-time responses, thanks to their specialized nature. This attribute is invaluable in applications
     requiring quick decision-making, such as autonomous vehicles—ant—medical diagnostics.

* some real-time examples of Narrow Al applications:
  1. Virtual Personal Assistants:
      1. _Examples_: Siri (Apple), Alexa (Amazon), Google Assistant
      2. _Capabilities_: These virtual assistants use natural language processing (NLP) to understand and respond to user queries. They can perform tasks like setting
       reminders, sending messages, and providing information based on predefined commands.

  2. Image and Speech Recognition:
      1. _Examples_: Google Photos, Microsoft Face ID, Speech-to-Text applications
      2. _Capabilities_: Narrow Al systems can analyze images to recognize faces, objects, and scenes. Speech recognition applications convert spoken language into text,               enabling hands-free operation and transcription services.
         
  3. Recommendation Systems:
      1. _Examples_: Netflix recommendations, Amazon product recommendations, Spotify playlists
      2. _Capabilities_: Narrow Al algorithms analyze user behavior and preferences to
